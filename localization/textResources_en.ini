Base64 encoding schemes are commonly used when there is a need to encode binary data that need to be stored and transferred over media that are designed to deal with textual data.</p> <p>Source <a rel='nofollow' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64'>Wikipedia</a></p>"

description="<h3>About Siskov-tools</h3><p>Siskov tools collects a set of various developer tools mainly divided in two sections: encodings and hashes. Base64, Url and Html tools allow encoding and decoding from and to base64 encoding, html escaping and url encoding. Hash generation tools include calculation of md5, sha-1, sha-256 and sha-512 hashes. Additionally calculation of HMAC with the corresponding hashes is posiible. As additional tool is htpasswd generator which allows creation of apache users by using 3 methods: crypt, md5 and sha-1. All (except download decoded base64) features are implemented in Javascript which means that no data is send via network while using the tools.</p>"
